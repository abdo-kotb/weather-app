## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for the weather by their cities name
- See their city name, different temperatures, a description of the weather, wind, humidity, and pressure degrees
- See an icon representing the weather state
- see a background of their cities cultures
- See an error message in case their input was wrong, and see the error disappears when they input the correct city name
